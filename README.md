SMART PRICE COMPARATOR
Smart Price Comparator is a web-based application designed to help users find the best price for a particular product across various online shopping websites. The system allows users to search for a product by name, model, or keyword, and automatically compares its prices on multiple e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, eBay, and others.

The application gathers price and product information in real time using web scraping and API integration, then displays a clear, side-by-side comparison to help users make informed purchasing decisions quickly and efficiently.

By centralizing price data from different websites, Smart Price Comparator saves time, reduces manual searching, and ensures that customers always get the best available deal.
